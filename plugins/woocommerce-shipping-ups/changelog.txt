*** UPS Shipping ***

2013.02.05 - version 2.0.2
 * Updated WC_Boxpack classes to be in sync with other shipping methods.

2013.02.01 - version 2.0.1

 * Added environment check for no credentials, no packaging chosen or defined, and no services chosen.
 * If packing method is set to "pack boxes" and no UPS packaging nor custom boxes defined will default to individual packing.
 * Fixed weight calculation. Round up to nearest 1lb for package.
 * Added better debug reporting when no rates returned.  This could be caused by requesting international rate when shipping domestically.
